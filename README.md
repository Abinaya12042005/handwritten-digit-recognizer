# 🖊 Handwritten Digit Recognizer using CNN (MNIST)

This project was built as part of my internship at **CodeC Technologies**.

## 🔍 Objective
Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model was also tested using a real handwritten digit image.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib, NumPy
- PIL / OpenCV for image preprocessing

## 🧠 Model
The CNN consists of:
- Conv2D → MaxPooling2D → Conv2D → MaxPooling2D
- Flatten → Dense → Output Layer (10 classes)

## 📈 Results
- Achieved 98%+ accuracy on test dataset
- Successfully predicted manually written digit image
